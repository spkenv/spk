class Decision:
    """Decision represents a change in state for the solver.

    Decisions form a tree structure. Each decision can have a single
    parent, and any number of child branches which should represent
    different possible subsequent decisions made by the solver.

    The root decision in the tree will not have a parent, and generally
    holds the set of initial requests for a resolve.

    Decisions provide the state of the resolve after this decision has been
    applied by merging the decision changes with all parents.

    Decisions usually resolve a single package request and optionally
    add additional requests (from depenencies). If a dependency
    is added which invalidates a previously resolved package, they
    can also 'reopen/unresolve' a package to be resolved again.
    If some unrecoverable issue caused the solver's not to be able to
    continue from the parent state, decision.get_error() will return
    the relevant exception.
